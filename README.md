🌍 Cloud-Based Content Delivery Network (CDN)

🚀 Build a Simple CDN to Deliver Static Content (Images & Videos) from Cloud Storage

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a cloud-based Content Delivery Network (CDN) using AWS S3 and CloudFront to efficiently serve static content like images and videos. By leveraging AWS's scalable architecture, this solution ensures faster content delivery, reduced latency, and improved availability worldwide.

🔥 Key Features
✅ Static Website Hosting – AWS S3 is used to store and serve static assets
✅ Content Delivery via CDN – AWS CloudFront optimizes global content distribution
✅ Fast Load Times – Caching and edge locations reduce latency
✅ Secure Access Control – Configured IAM roles & S3 bucket policies
✅ Scalable & Cost-Effective – Pay-as-you-go model ensures efficiency

🛠️ Technologies Used
Amazon S3 – Object storage for hosting static content
Amazon CloudFront – CDN for fast and secure content delivery
AWS IAM – Access control for secure content management
Route 53 (Optional) – Custom domain integration
HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Basic frontend for accessing CDN-hosted content

📖 What I Learned
🔹 How to configure S3 buckets for static hosting
🔹 How to set up CloudFront distributions for content acceleration
🔹 How to secure content delivery using IAM policies & bucket permissions
🔹 How to optimize caching and content invalidation for performance
🔹 How to integrate a CDN with a static website for seamless user experience

🚀 Deployment Steps
1️⃣ Create an S3 bucket and enable static website hosting
2️⃣ Upload images and videos to S3 for distribution
3️⃣ Configure CloudFront to deliver content globally
4️⃣ Set up security policies to restrict or allow access
5️⃣ Optimize caching & performance for better speed

📌 Why This Project Matters
A CDN helps deliver static assets efficiently across different regions, improving website performance and user experience. By implementing AWS S3 & CloudFront, this project showcases a scalable, cost-effective solution for serving media files with minimal latency.
